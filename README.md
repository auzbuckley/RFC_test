# What are RFCs?

RFCs (Requests for Comments) are intended to help make decision-making more collaborative and transparent. They are used mostly for internal solution proposals i.e. process changes, tech solutioning, and anything that is not addressing an external business or product opportunity - for which the Opportunity Canvas is more suitable.
