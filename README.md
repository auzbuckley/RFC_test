# What are RFCs?

RFCs (Requests for Comments) are intended to help make decision-making more collaborative and transparent. They are used mostly for internal solution proposals i.e. process changes, tech solutioning, and anything that is not addressing an external business or product opportunity - for which the Opportunity Canvas is more suitable.

# But I've never used github before... isn't it for developers?
There might be a bit of steep learning curve, but fear not, you won't need to use the console :) Here is a quick step-by-step on how to submit an RFC via github.

**Step 1. Prepare yourself man!**  
Make sure you have an editor where you can visualize markdown. Or we recommend using https://stackedit.io/app#. Here you can save your file to your google drive or even directly to Github.

**Step 2. Get on with it already**  
Come here and copy the RFCs/RFC_template.md file to your text editor. Write your RFC, making sure to fill out the template. Take your time and save the file between creative writing sessions as you would any other file.

**Step 3. Submit your RFC!**  
When you've finished your master piece, open up this repository and click 'upload file'. At the bottom, before clicking the big green 'Commit changes' button make sure you select 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.' and name the branch with the following naming convention:

`RFC-Your-title-here-v1.0`

**Step 4. Your time will come...**  
Your pull request has now been submitted and a trigger has been sent to our RFC slack channel to request review. Now is your time to sit back, and... get back to work.

**Step 5. No one is perfect.**  
People may start commenting on your PR (Pull Request for those of you less nerdy people). You reply back to explain yourself, or you can make an amendment. Conveniently you can do this within Github. Just edit the file and when you're done commit your changes again following Step 3. But this time add the versioning e.g. `RFC-Your-title-here-v1.1` and leaving a brief commit message that summarizes what you changed.

**Note:** Markdown (the markup language used for formatting text in Github) can be a bit tricky to get the hang of if you're not used to it. Incidently, you might find helpful some tips on how to write Markdown  [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
